Determining Confluence page value
==========================================

**Confluence** pages are regularly assessed by the developer team and by a *team approver*.

The *team approver* role is an optional role for each Scrum or developer team. The member assigned as a team approver checks if a Confluence page is usable, or classified as for internal/team use only.

.. note::

	The *technical writer* does not necessarily take on the *team approver* role. Ideally, the person taking on the role should be part of the developer team, although the task can be taken up by an external staff member.

Confluence pages can be classified as *Controlled* or *Uncontrolled* pages.

Controlled pages
------------------

  - **Reference pages**

    These Confluence pages are for end-users, stakeholders, and customers. These pages are also used to answer questions and inquiries from other developer teams. These pages are identified by the team approver, manager, architect or owner.

  - **Presentation pages**

    These pages are for introducing team developments and does not necessarily carry technical information. These pages are reviewed by the team approver.

Uncontrolled pages
------------------

  - **For archive/removal**

    These pages are redundant and has no value to the developer team or future end-users. These pages are identified by the team approver or by lead developers/architects.

  - **Team use only**

    These pages are for internal team use only and not made available during presentations.
