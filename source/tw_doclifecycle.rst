The Document Life Cycle continues
=====================================

Some technical writers and editors believe that once an article, topic or document is published, the document's life ends there. However, there is much that happens behind the scenes that are invisible to the writer, but relevant to what is called the document or publication life cycle.

Publishing has long stopped being just about writing, printing and reproducing, as it was with the old printing presses and typesetting machines. It was never just about print on paper. Even as far back as the First World War, there were sophisticated methods for securing, archiving and reproducing documents. In the last decade, companies such as Google and Microsoft, as well as libraries and museums all over the world, made a concentrated effort to digitize books and documents for public consumption on the Internet. The process not only involved manpower but leveraged technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), document conversion software, Enterprise-level servers and powerful relational databases.

The Document Life Cycle Today
----------------------------------

In today's digital age, the document life cycle is so complex that companies have dedicated personnel, methods and systems that handle how documents are processed before, during and after publishing. There are professionals with job titles such as *Documentation Engineer, Archiver, Information Specialist* and *Content Management Administrator*. Moreover, bespoke software such as fully specialized backend Document Management Systems, CMSs and document tool chains are used as engines and repositories in the background. Programmers use document generators and a host of languages to create documentation from code, dispensing the need for a technical writer. The concepts of reuse, structured documents, catalogs, document transformation and schemas are mentioned alongside acronyms such as **XML, DITA, EPUB, XLIFF, PDF, HTML** and **DCN**. 

Automated solutions have helped the publication life cycle become largely invisible to the writer. However, technical communicators, translators and documentation specialists should never take the process for granted. The ISO 9000 family of Quality Management Systems emphasizes the importance of document control and discusses document releasing, approving, versioning and change management. Each company, however, has their own way of defining the important aspects of publication and storage.

In the world of tablets, smartphones, standards-compliant web browsers and apps, the following aspects of publication are as important as ever:

1. Metadata
2. Validation
3. Indexing
4. Retrieval and distribution
5. Capture and document preservation
6. Security
7. Compatibility

Writing and documentation, at first glance, seem far from the sophisticated halls of hardware and software, but it is still an integral part of the information landscape. Text is fluid, flexible and ever-changing. The nature of publications has evolved alongside technology and the document life cycle will (and should) evolve and grow with it.
