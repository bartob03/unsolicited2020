Word 2016 TOC, hyperlinks, and PDFs
========================================

Users of **Adobe Reader** or third-party PDF viewers are no doubt accustomed to using the **Bookmarks/Document** tree pane for clicking chapters and sections of a PDF document. However, if you want your readers to also have clickable links on the table of contents itself once a Word document is exported to PDF, perform the following steps on the Word document before you export the **.docx** file to PDF:

1. Right-click the Word document's table of contents, and then click **Edit Field**.

2. Select **TOC** from the **Field** names box, and then click **Table of Contents**.

3. Select **Use hyperlinks instead of page numbers**.

   By default, the **Use hyperlinks instead of page numbers** is selected, unless your school, company, or organization modified the basic **.docx** template. If this box is unchecked, table of content entries can't be used to navigate around the Word document on the **.docx** file and the exported PDF.

.. note::

	The entries shown in the **Navigation Pane** in Word don't necessarily reflect what bookmarks will appear on your output PDF file. The **Navigation Pane** includes all levels of a Word document based on the **Heading** styles you use. You can view the **Navigation Pane** by clicking the **View tab > Navigation Pane**.

4. Increase the number of levels that appear on the TOC using the **Show levels** setting or click **Options** and modify the TOC level as needed. The TOC levels selected determines the depth of the document tree that appears on the PDF output's **Bookmark** pane. Click **OK**.

.. note::

	 You can also select which styles are included as part of the TOC levels.

5. Click **File > Export > Create PDF/XPS Document > Create PDF/XPS**.

.. note::

	 As always, make sure your table of contents is updated before exporting the Word document to PDF.

6. If you want the smallest file size for your PDF, select **Minimum size**, and then click **Options**.

7. Ensure that the option **Create bookmarks using Headings** is selected, and then click **OK**.

8. Click **Publish**.

   The PDF output will have bookmarks created for the table of content entries and any table of content entries on the PDF will be clickable.

.. note::

	 The clickable entries on the table of contents will not work with all third-party PDF viewers for **Android, iOS,** or **Windows 10 Mobile**. Most PDF apps, however, can detect bookmarks on a PDF created from Word.
