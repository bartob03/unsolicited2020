In **Windows**, if you find yourself unable to open an **InDesign** file using **InDesign CS6**, try opening the file as a copy instead.

To open an InDesign file as a copy:

1. Click **File > Open** then navigate to the InDesign file.

2. Select **Copy** under **Open As**, and then click **Open**.
