Creating Customer Release Notes
==================================

Overview
---------

This document provides an overview of customer release notes and provides links to internal customer release notes resources.

Audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document is for any software team member required to write release notes for a product, solution, or software build.

Customer release notes overview
---------------------------------

*Customer Release Notes* (CRNs) are brief documents describing a software product release. They are not comprehensive, and are different from user manuals, white papers, and formal user documentation. However, they may refer to support documentation, and may correct or contain information from existing documentation. CRNs are written to supplement or add to existing documentation, not replace them. They are included as part of a product, and made available to all users.

Customer release notes audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CRNs are written for a specific audience, and may be targetted to both technical and non-technical customers. It is assumed that CRNs will be delivered or packaged along with the software product or release, and made available internally within the software provider and publicly to customers.

Release notes are intended for the following audience:

- Customers, clients, and stakeholders
- Third-party vendors
- Customer service and technical service providers
- Quality staff
- Internal development staff
- End-users

Customer release notes content
---------------------------------

The content of CRNs can vary depending on the software product and the release version. For example, release notes can be more extensive if it's a new product, compared with a legacy or classic product with only incremental updates. Moreover, release notes written for a product in its development stage can be highly detailed in terms of listing bugs and fixes.

CRNs can contain any of the following information:

- Date of release
- Previous and relevant release and patch versions
- Deprecated code
- Platform or language change
- Fixed bugs and issues
- Compatibility information
- Software or hardware requirement changes
- 3rd party software components
- Software changes, improvements, and enhancements
- Brief patch installation steps
- Relevant source code
- Testing process and test environment
- Supported and unsupported versions of software
- Source of the issue
- Version changes
- Ongoing and known issues
- Workarounds
- Warnings
- End-user impact
- Disclaimers and compliance information
- List of FOSS included in the product
- Support and contact information
- Usage updates or operational changes
- Software roadmap
- Localization
- Reference and documentation links

.. note::

	Internal and external CRN templates are available as Confluence template pages, which can be exported to PDF or Word as needed.
