   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Offered But Unsolicited
========================================

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:
   :caption: Contents:

   self
   twriter_description
   step_introduction
   apidoc_racidiagram
   releasenotes_creating
   writingpublishingsphinx
   msproject2016_float
   retext
   confluence_pagevalue
   githubpages_javadoc

.. contents:: Articles
   :depth: 3

// add the property ``:glob:`` and the item ``folder-name/*`` to add all contents of a folder.
// use ``self`` to refer to the page with the toctree directive. ``.. contents`` is for the left navigation tab.
// for all documents ``*``
// You add a toctree to main headings like Linux for child pages!!! It makes sense!!
