Removing text highlights in InDesign
======================================

If you open an **.indd** file from a different user and your system doesn't have the fonts the document uses, **InDesign** will automatically highlight all the text which used substituted fonts. If using substituted fonts isn't an issue for you or you don't need the highlights, you can disable this helpful but somewhat annoying feature.

.. note:: The steps listed are for **Adobe InDesign CS6**, but should be fairly similar to earlier and later versions of **Adobe InDesign**.

To disable highlights for substituted fonts:

1. Click **Edit > Preferences > Composition**.

2. Clear the **Substituted Fonts** box.
