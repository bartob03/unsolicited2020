Fixing misaligned images in an imported Word document in FrameMaker 11
=========================================================================

When importing Word documents into **FrameMaker 11**, one of the most common problems encountered by users is how images are aligned in the document. In some cases, images that were aligned properly in **Word** are outside the page area in **FrameMaker**. To resolve this issue, adjust the **Tab Stops** of the **Headings** and **Body Text**. The images will follow the alignment of the **Body Text** tab stops.

To adjust the tab stops to align images in an imported Word document:

1. Click to select the text of the imported Word document.

3. Click **View > Paragraph Designer**.

4. Select text that is tagged as *Heading 2* or *Heading 1* in the document or select *Heading 1* or *Heading 2* from the list in **Paragraph Designer**.

5. Adjust the tab stops using the markers on the ruler or by inputting values in the **Tab Stops** box in **Paragraph Designer**. If needed, perform the same steps for the **Body Text Paragraph** tag.

   .. tip::

	    If the rulers are not visible, click **View > Rulers**.
